Hi! My name is Daniar Kasenov and I am a linguist. Currently I am a 1st year PhD student at NYU Linguistics. See the CV tab for further info. NB! Some info on this site is necessarily out-of-date.

I work on theoretical approaches to morphology and its interactions with other domains of grammar (morpho-syntax, morpho-phonology, morpho-semantics, etc.)

Feel free to contact me: dk4981-at-nyu-dot-edu
