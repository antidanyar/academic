### Hi! My name is Daniar Kasenov and I am a theoretical linguist. 
  + Here is how to pronounce my name 
    + in Russian: [d^ɣ^ən^j^iˈjar k^ɣ^aˈs^j^en^ɣ^əf^ɣ^]
    + in English: [ˈdæniər kəˈsɛnəv]
  + My research focuses on topics related to natural language morphology:
    + morpheme-specific phonological processes
    + locality of allomorphy conditioning and *ABA patterns
    + morphosemantics of nominal features
  + My other major interest is topics related to the nature of grammaticality:
    + ellipsis and its (in)ability to repair ungrammatical structures
    + meaning-driven ungrammaticality (oddness in any context)
  + I am a grad student at NYU Linguistics, advised by Maria Gouskova
    + See the CV tab for further info
    + Feel free to contact me: dk4981-at-nyu-dot-edu
