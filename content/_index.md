### Hi! My name is Daniar Kasenov and I am a theoretical linguist. 
{{< figure height="35%" width="35%" src="Kasenov_photo.jpg" title="That's me around April 2025." >}}
  + Here is how to pronounce my name 
    + in Russian: [d<sup>ɣ</sup>ən<sup>j</sup>iˈjar<sup>ɣ</sup> k<sup>ɣ</sup>aˈs<sup>j</sup>en<sup>ɣ</sup>əf<sup>ɣ</sup>]
    + in English: [ˈdæniər kəˈsɛnəv]
  + My research focuses on topics related to natural language morphology:
    + morpheme-specific phonological processes
    + locality of allomorphy conditioning and *ABA patterns
    + morphosemantics of nominal features
  + My other major interest is topics related to the nature of grammaticality:
    + ellipsis and its (in)ability to repair ungrammatical structures
    + meaning-driven ungrammaticality (oddness in any context)
  + I am a grad student at NYU Linguistics, advised by Maria Gouskova
