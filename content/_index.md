### Hi! My name is Daniar Kasenov and I am a theoretical linguist. 
  + I work on a variety of topics, most have to do with the division of labor of syntactic structure and post-syntactic mechanisms in accounting for non-syntactic phenomena (such as allomorphy, morpheme order, implicature computation)
  + Currently I am a 1st year graduate student at NYU Linguistics Department
  + Before that I have spent 4 years at the lab of formal models in linguistics in HSE University (Moscow, Russia)
  + See the CV tab for further info
  + Feel free to contact me: dk4981-at-nyu-dot-edu
