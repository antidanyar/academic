Hi! My name is Daniar Kasenov and I am a linguist. Currently I work as a research assistant at HSE  Formal Linguistics Lab (Moscow).

My interests lie in the domain of generative grammar. More narrowly:

+ Allosemy as a theory of syntax-semantics interface

+ Syntactic theories of morphology (DM, Nanosyntax)

+ Modular approaches to morpho-phonology (CVCV, Precedence-based phonology)
