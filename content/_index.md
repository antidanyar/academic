### Hi! My name is Daniar Kasenov and I am a theoretical linguist. 
  + My research focuses on variety of topics related to natural language morphology, such as:
    + morpheme-specific phonological processes
    + locality of allomorphy conditioning and *ABA patterns
    + morphosemantics of nominal features
  + My other major interest is topics related to the nature of grammaticality, such as:
    + ellipsis and its (in)ability to repair ungrammatical structures
    + meaning-driven ungrammaticality (oddness in any context)
  + Currently I am a graduate student at NYU Linguistics Department, advised by Maria Gouskova
    + Before that I have spent 4 years at the lab of formal models in linguistics in HSE University (Moscow, Russia), advised by Pavel Rudnev and Alexander Podobryaev
    + See the CV tab for further info
    + Feel free to contact me: dk4981-at-nyu-dot-edu
