Hi! My name is Daniar Kasenov and I am a linguist. Currently I work as a research assistant at HSE  Formal Linguistics Lab (Moscow). See the CV tab for further info.

My interests lie in the domain of generative grammar. More narrowly:

+ Theories of syntax-semantics interface, esp. allosemy and other late-insertion-at-LF theories

+ Syntactic theories of morphology (DM, Nanosyntax)

+ Modular approaches to morpho-phonology (CVCV, Precedence-based phonology)

Feel free to contact me: antidanyar@protonmail.com
